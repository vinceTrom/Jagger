# Jagger
Jagger is a Jabber UI client for Android that you can easily use for your app.

Jagger comes from the creation of a Chat UI for the Winkli app I co-founded.
Giving your users the possibility to chat with other users increase his engagement, or can be at the heart of your product.
But creating a Jabber Client/Server is hard and long, implementing the push mecanism too.
The goal of this project is to help you to deploy your own Jabber Server, connect a Chat UI on your Android device to it, and offer chat push capabilities.
